<p>one of the most absorbing concepts in todays society is computer science. this vast yet free-flowing industry has various different routes and tracks to pursue and further understand. </p>
<p>the main reason, i decided to pursue this career is because i want to be a part of change. not ordinary change, change within the world and how the future is going to be shaped. not only does this spark my interest, but it motivates me to create and think outside the box. these changes can transform the world as we know it and take one step into the progressive future that is not only more sustainable but also idealized by a vast majority of people. </p>

<h2 id="previously">interests</h2>
<p>while the industry has many different outlets, there are a few that grab my attention over the others. these include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>botting/reselling</strong> - fascinated with the intersection of software and reselling market of product. More importantly, finding the best median to not only make a fluid automated product, but to ensure that reselling is catered to everyone. </li>
<li><strong>video games</strong> - interested in underatanding the fundamentals of the video game industry. Augmented reality, and spacial recognition are subgenres that are not only interesting, but i believe will craft and outline the future of this vertical. </li>
<li><strong>automobile/cars</strong> - i have always been fascinated with the idea of cars and the software that goes into them. self-driving cars are not only the future but can allow for a safer means of transportation. understanding the ins and outs of this category within software will only allow for a flourishing future.</li>
<li><strong>climate tech</strong> - one of the most interesting and yet important topics within the field, there is a huge amount of progress needed within this industry. we have a huge factor working against us: time. if steps are not made towards eco-sustainability, there can be irreversible damage to our planet. </li>
</ul>
